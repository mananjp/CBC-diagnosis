# CBC - Medical Diagnosis Classification using Machine Learning

A comprehensive machine learning project for automated medical diagnosis classification using advanced ML algorithms and clinical validation.

---

## Overview

This project develops and validates machine learning models for automated medical diagnosis classification. Using clinical datasets, we implement multiple ML algorithms to predict disease categories with high accuracy, providing detailed performance analysis including confusion matrices, feature importance, ROC AUC scores, and cross-validation results. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnostic decision-making through data-driven insights.
